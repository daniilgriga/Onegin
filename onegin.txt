my uncle -- high ideals inspire him;
but when past joking he fell sick,
he really forced one to admire him --
and never played a shrewder trick.
let others learn from his example!
but God, how deadly dull to sample
sickroom attendance night and day
and never stir a foot away!
and the sly baseness, fit to throttle,
of entertaining the half-dead:
one smoothes the pillows down in bed,
and glumly serves the medicine bottle,
and sighs, and asks oneself all through:
when will the devil come for you?
